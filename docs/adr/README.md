# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This folder contains Architecture Decision Records for the project.

## Purpose

ADRs capture **why** significant architectural decisions were made.

## Rules

- ADRs are immutable once accepted
- A decision is never edited; it is superseded by a new ADR
- ADRs do not describe the full system design

## Naming Convention

adr-XXX-short-title.md

## Usage

Other documentation may reference ADRs but must not restate their content.
